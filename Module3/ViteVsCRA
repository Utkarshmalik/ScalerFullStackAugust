1. Development Speed

Vite: Uses a technique called ES Module (ESM) loading in development, where modules are requested individually instead of being bundled upfront. This leads to almost instantaneous startup times, even with large projects.

CRA: Uses Webpack, which bundles everything at startup. As projects grow, this bundling process takes more time, resulting in slower server start times and live reload delays.

2. Build Time

Vite: Internally uses Rollup for production builds, optimizing the bundling process to produce smaller and more efficient bundles.

CRA: Uses Webpack for production builds, which can be slower due to its bundling strategies and additional configuration.
