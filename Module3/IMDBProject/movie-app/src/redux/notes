1. configureStore

configureStore is a utility that helps set up a Redux store with sensible defaults. It automatically includes middleware like Redux Thunk (for handling asynchronous actions) and Redux DevTools for debugging.


2. createSlice

createSlice is a function that helps you define actions and reducers in a more concise way.  It automatically generates action creators and action types based on the reducers you provide. This greatly reduces boilerplate code.



createAsyncThunk is a utility provided by Redux Toolkit to handle asynchronous logic like API calls. It simplifies the process of dispatching actions for async operations (e.g., fetching data from a server) and managing the resulting state.

Key Features

Automatically generates three lifecycle action types for an async operation:

pending: The operation has started.
fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
rejected: The operation failed.

Works seamlessly with Redux Toolkit's slices to manage state transitions during these lifecycles.




What is extraReducers?

extraReducers is a special field in a Redux Toolkit slice that allows you to handle actions outside the slice's own reducers.

Why Do We Need extraReducers?
To handle the lifecycle actions (pending, fulfilled, rejected) of async thunks created using createAsyncThunk.
To respond to actions that are not part of the slice's reducers.
