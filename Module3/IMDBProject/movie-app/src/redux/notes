1. configureStore

configureStore is a utility that helps set up a Redux store with sensible defaults. It automatically includes middleware like Redux Thunk (for handling asynchronous actions) and Redux DevTools for debugging.


2. createSlice

createSlice is a function that helps you define actions and reducers in a more concise way.  It automatically generates action creators and action types based on the reducers you provide. This greatly reduces boilerplate code.
