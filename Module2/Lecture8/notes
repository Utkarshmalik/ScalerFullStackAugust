Document: The root node that represents the entire HTML document.
Elements: Represent each tag in the HTML document. These are the nodes that have children (inner elements or text).

Change styles: Modify the CSS of elements to change their appearance.
Respond to events: Set up event listeners to respond to user actions like clicks, keyboard input, or page loading.
