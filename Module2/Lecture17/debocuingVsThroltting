Debouncing and throttling are both techniques used to control how often a function is executed in response to an event

When to Use Debouncing

Debouncing ensures that a function is only executed once after a specified delay, no matter how many times an event is triggered. It is useful when you want to wait until the user has stopped triggering events before taking action.

Ideal for:

Search input fields: When a user types in a search box, you only want to send the search request once the user has stopped typing.

Window resizing: When resizing a window, you may want to wait until the user has finished resizing before adjusting the layout.

Form validation on user input: You may want to validate a field only after the user has stopped typing to avoid validating for every keystroke.


When to Use Throttling

Throttling limits the execution of a function to once every specified interval, regardless of how often the event occurs. This is useful when you want to ensure a function is executed at regular intervals, even if the event is triggered continuously.

Ideal for:

Button click: In situations where a button could be clicked multiple times in quick succession, throttling ensures that the action only happens once every set interval.

API rate limiting: When sending requests to an API, throttling can prevent too many requests from being sent in a short time, adhering to rate limits.



Debouncing: Use when you want to wait until a user action has "settled" (e.g., input, resizing).
Throttling: Use when you want to limit the execution rate of a function, even when an event is fired continuously (e.g., scroll, button clicks).
